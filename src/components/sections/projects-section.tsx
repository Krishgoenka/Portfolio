    title: 'Resume Advisor (ATS System)',
    shortDescription: 'AI-powered system for skill-gap identification and candidate-job matching.',
    longDescription: `Resume Advisor is an AI-powered platform designed to help job seekers improve their resumes. It allows users (Applicants or HR) to upload resumes (PDFs) and job descriptions. The system analyzes these documents to provide personalized feedback, identify skill gaps, suggest improvements, and optimize for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) by highlighting crucial keywords. The goal is to enhance a candidate's chances in the competitive job market by offering actionable insights.`,

    title: 'Brain Tumour Detection using MRI',
    shortDescription: 'AI model to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans.',
    longDescription: "Developed during the AI Unite Hackathon by team nvAI, this project utilizes Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Segmentation techniques with a CNN-based model to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The model, which achieved an 89% accuracy on its test dataset, aims to assist medical professionals by highlighting potential tumorous regions and classifying tumor types, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and speed. The server component is powered by Flask, hosted on a Linode instance, accepting MRI images and returning detailed JSON responses.",
